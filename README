This is the documentation that will be attached to final for a discription of 
the code on how to use it and read it. That is by giving the explicit definition
of all of the variables and in what positions mean what.

Static Variables
ms = main state bit array
is = input state bit array
os = output state bit array

fb = file buffer
fbb = file back buffer
lb = line buffer
lbb = line back buffer
len = length storage array for buffers
x = storage of place in line
y = storage of line of file
c = current char being read
i = main program cycle (if in main loop)

Ref Values
a[] = integer array
b[] = bit array
ch[] = char array

m[] = main bit array
i[] = input bit array
o[] = output bit array
l[] = length storage array

b = bit
l = length
n = number 
r = relativity
c = character
sx = starting letter
sy = starting line
ex = ending letter
ey = ending line
